# harmonize-io
harmonize.io is a web application that takes in any melody uploaded by the user as an input and returns a harmonized version of the melody. It takes an uploaded melody as a MIDI file along with additional parameters such as the rhythm of the harmonies as input and returns a MIDI file of the harmonized melody as the output. It is intended for music composers with a wide range of skills and knowledge starting from novice composers who are not aware of how harmony can be used to expert composers who can use this tool for fresh and innovative harmonies.

# How It Works

The algorithm that harmonizes any melody was designed using two musical concepts:

 - Strong Voice Leadings

    - The harmonies move in step-wise motion. This means that each harmony note moves gradually from one note to the next. For our ears, this sounds very pleasant as each individual harmony note is moving in small steps which forms a cohesive line, similar to that of a melody or bassline.

 - Consonance & Dissonance

    - Like any story, music, built with melodies and harmonies, needs to have tension and release for an interesting and engaging narrative. This, using harmony, is achieved through the usage of consonant (pleasant-sounding) harmonies and dissonant (tense-sounding) harmonies. When planned well, building up tension through dissonant harmonies and releasing it through consonant ones can result in pleasing and engaging music.

These abstract musical concepts were analysed and codified into an algorithm written in the Python programming language.
